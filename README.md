### 02/05/24: Plastics-input-into-the-global-ocean

R scripts developped for the project in collaboration with Charlotte Laufkoetter (Uni. Bern) & Kevin Lang. The goal of the project was to model and predict waste production per country and per year (1990-2019) based on societal predictors such as % urban pop, GDP, access to electricity, etc. using GAMS, Random Forest (RF), and Neural Networks (NNET). My role was to provide to Charlotte Laufk√∂tter a long table (countries x year) containing the annual estimates of waste production. She then used those to predict the total amount of plastics that entered the ocean over a certain period using a waste treatment flow model.
